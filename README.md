# Caesar Cipher

## What is Caesar Cipher?
A Caesar cipher is a simple way to hide a message by shifting each letter forward or backward in the alphabet by a fixed number.
Example: shifting everything by 3 turns A → D, B → E, C → F, etc.

## GK about it
- Created by Julius Caesar — He used it to send secret military messages.
- Around 100 BCE — That’s roughly when it was first recorded in use.
- Shift-based encryption — Every letter is moved by a fixed number (Caesar used a shift of 3).
- One of the oldest ciphers — Considered one of the earliest known methods of encryption in history.
- Very easy to break today — Because there are only 25 possible shifts, modern computers (and even humans) can crack it instantly.

## Why I made this?
I made this just as a fun way to explore more CSS and JS. This is also a submission to an even I am doing via Hack Club -  Moonshot!
It is just as a backup project incase they reject my other project!
